# .htaccess — Web root (parent of /2.0/)
#
# Redirects all requests outside /2.0/ to the WordPress site.
# This catches legacy URLs (e.g. /2009/fruit.shtml) that are still
# reachable on the server and getting indexed by search engines.
#
# Replaces the old root .htaccess which only redirected /index.php.
# The WordPress-specific .htaccess lives separately inside /2.0/ and
# handles WP rewrites, caching, HTTPS, etc.

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On

    # Skip requests that are already targeting /2.0/ (WordPress handles those)

    # Skip robots.txt — must be served from the web root for search engines
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/robots\.txt$ [NC]

    # Everything else: permanent redirect (301) to the WordPress homepage
    RewriteRule ^ https://%{HTTP_HOST}/2.0/ [R=301,L]
