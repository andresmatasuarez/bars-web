# The BARS website lives entirely under /2.0/ (WordPress).
# Everything outside /2.0/ is legacy content that should not be crawled.
#
# How it works:
#   Disallow: /        — blocks crawling of ALL paths by default
#   Allow: /2.0/       — re-allows crawling inside the WordPress installation
#
# Net effect: only /2.0/* is crawled; old paths like /2009/ are ignored.

# WordPress generates a sitemap at this URL (via wp-sitemap.xml).
